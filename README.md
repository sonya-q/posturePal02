# 🐶 Posture Pal

**Posture Pal** is an interactive, posture-correcting desk companion created for **BoxBots 2025**, a hardware hackathon focused on robotics and human-centered design.

Teammates: Sonya Qu, Ariel Liu, Mansi Katarey, Alexandra

Using **OpenCV**, **Python**, and **Arduino**, it monitors your posture in real time and responds through a cardboard robotic pet that reacts to your body alignment, gently encouraging you to sit up straight.
